# 30 Days for Projects

## I am making this project just to learn more i guess. 

It's been some time since I've coded everyday but now I'm going to code for the next 30 days non-stop. 
I'm also going heavy on leetcode so if you want to do mock interviews together let me know.
We don't really get time to learn but with this I hope I'll learn a lot.
