# 30 Projects

## I am making this project just to learn more i guess. 

It's been some time since I've coded everyday but now I'm going to code for the next 30 days non-stop. 
I'm also going heavy on leetcode so if you want to do mock interviews together let me know.
We don't really get time to learn but with this I hope I'll learn a lot. Statrted out slow but now this is fun.

## Project 1 - Homepage

* https://jenniferdewalt.com/index.html - Jennifer Dewalt - Thanks for the inspiration.

## Project 2 - Contact Form

## Project 3 - About Me


## Project 4 - HashCode Documentation

* [https://github.com/CONNECT-platform/codedoc](https://github.com/CONNECT-platform/codedoc) - CODEDOC to learn documentation (Learned Latex because of this project)

## Project 5 - Chronicle Hackathon

* Used a template to learn about the animations but can't find the owner (will find it to give due credits) because deleted readme by mistake. 

* Learned more about Animations using CSS and Javascript


## Project 6 - Git Fake Commit Bot

* Experimented around with selenium to make some cool bots and actually tried to fake my commit score just to test whether that can actually happen. I also made alinkedin scraper with this. This was a really cool project.

## Project 7 - Planet - A University of Melbourne Course Planner

* This project is still under progress. The most time consuming project ever. 

* Thanks to *Parth* for teaching me React.js from basics and sticking with me throughout this one. Once made this would be pretty amazing
* Learned React.JS, How to deploy a website, Making a backend with MongoDB.

## Project 8 - Citibank Hackathon

* A web application  using Flask which uses machine learning algorithms to detect fraud in bank cheques.

* Learned Flask and how to use Google Cloud Vision API, also made some custom models with pytesseract and Keras-OCR but they weren't that accurate because of less data. *We came second though*

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you are making something cool, I would love to learn new stuff.
